## _To Debug_

You need to install the following:

- ✨ [Java 8] - Java 8 is required, because higher versions are not supported with maven projects.
- ✨ [Java JDK 8] - Needed to work with the classes and methods that gearth implements.
- ✨ [IDE] - If it's your first time in Java, I recommend Intellij IDEA,
I had problems with Eclipse and NetBeans to create a maven project.
- ✨ [SceneBuilder] - It helps you in creating graphical user interfaces.

## Setting up the environment

Here you can find all the information to develop your first extension: https://github.com/sirjonasxx/G-ExtensionStore/wiki/Native-Extension
